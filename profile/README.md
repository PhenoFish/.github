## Welcome to the **_PhenoFish_** code space :wave:

Although they represent the largest diversity of vertebrates, we still lack comprehensive databases of fishes' traits. The **PHENOFISH** project aims to pool data on the biodiversity, morphology, behaviour and ecophysiology of marine and freshwater fishes that have never before been brought together. It brings together specialists in marine and freshwater ecology, spatial ecology (biogeography), ecophysiology, conservation ecology and behaviour. This complementarity in the characterisation of fish traits will advance our understanding of the processes, mechanisms and threats that influence fish species.

The research project **PHENOFISH** was selected from the [2022 DataSHARE Joint Call](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/calls/appel-a-projets-datashare-2022/) between the Centre for the Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity ([CESAB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/)) of the French Foundation for Biodiversity Research ([FRB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/)), the [LabEX TULIP](https://www.labex-tulip.fr/labex-tulip_eng/), the National Center for Biodiversity Data ([PNDB](https://www.pndb.fr/en/home)) and the challenge [BiodivOc](https://biodivoc.edu.umontpellier.fr/), supported by the [Occitanie Region](https://www.laregion.fr/) and the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/).
